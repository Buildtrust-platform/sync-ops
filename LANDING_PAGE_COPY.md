### Subheadline

The operating system for production, post, and distribution.
One place for briefs, assets, approvals, versions, rights, and delivery.
No spreadsheets. No lost files. No "which cut is this?"

## THE PROBLEM

### The reality of creative operations today:

**Briefing**
Requirements live in email threads, Slack DMs, and someone's head. Scope changes aren't tracked. Teams start work on outdated information.

**Scheduling**
Call sheets get revised four times. Crew availability lives in texts. No one knows who confirmed what.

**Ingest**
Raw footage sits on a hard drive in someone's bag. Or three drives. Or a folder called "MASTER_FINAL_v2_USE_THIS."

**Versions**
There's a "final" and a "final_REAL" and a "final_approved_v3_CLIENT." Legal signed off on something. No one's sure which file.

**Approvals**
Feedback is scattered across platforms. One stakeholder replied in Frame.io. Another sent a PDF with handwritten timestamps. The third hasn't responded in six days.

**Legal & Rights**
Talent releases are in a drawer. Music licenses expire next month. No one flagged it. The asset is already in market.

**Distribution**
Deliverables go out manually. Wrong specs. Wrong metadata. Wrong territory. Someone notices after it's live.

**Archive**
Projects end. Files vanish into cold storage with no taxonomy. Two years later, no one can find the hero shot for a rebrand.

---

This isn't a tooling problem. It's an operations problem.
And no amount of "better communication" fixes broken infrastructure.

## WHAT THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY DOES

SyncOps handles the operational layer of creative work—so your team can focus entirely on the work itself.

- **Single source of truth for every asset, version, and approval**
- **Automated ingest with AI-generated metadata, transcripts, and face detection**
- **Version control that actually works—linked to feedback, linked to sign-off**
- **Rights management with expiration alerts before problems become legal exposure**
- **Review workflows with frame-accurate comments, threaded replies, and clear status**
- **Role-based access so legal sees what legal needs, clients see what clients need**
- **Call sheet generation with crew confirmations and location logistics**
- **Distribution specs enforced automatically—no more "wrong format" rejections**
- **Archive with search. Find the shot. Find the contract. Find the signed release.**

The system doesn't do the creative work.
It does everything else.

## THE MASTERY PRINCIPLE

### Masters do the work. The system does the operations.

The best editors don't want to manage folder structures.
The best producers don't want to chase approvals.
The best directors don't want to wonder if legal cleared the music.

Mastery requires focus. Focus requires trust in the infrastructure around you.

SyncOps exists so that skilled people can stay in their craft—while the operational complexity runs quietly underneath.

We don't believe in tools that demand attention.
We believe in systems that disappear into the workflow.

You shouldn't have to think about operations.
You should just know it's handled.

## PHASE-BY-PHASE BREAKDOWN

### Brief
**The problem:** Requirements scatter across emails, decks, and verbal agreements—then change without record.
**The system:** Centralized briefs with version history, linked deliverables, and automatic stakeholder notification on every change.

---

### Pre-Production
**The problem:** Schedules, call sheets, and crew confirmations live in disconnected tools and personal messages.
**The system:** Integrated scheduling with location mapping, automated crew notifications, and real-time confirmation tracking.

---

### Ingest
**The problem:** Raw assets arrive unnamed, unorganized, and untracked—then get duplicated across drives.
**The system:** Automated ingest with AI tagging, transcription, face detection, and instant searchability across the entire library.

---

### Post
**The problem:** Version control collapses under revision pressure. "Final" loses all meaning.
**The system:** Immutable version history with linked feedback, clear approval chains, and zero ambiguity about current status.

---

### Review & Legal
**The problem:** Feedback scatters across platforms. Rights documents live in filing cabinets. Expirations go unnoticed.
**The system:** Frame-accurate review with threaded comments, integrated rights tracking, and automated expiration alerts.

---

### Distribution
**The problem:** Deliverables fail spec requirements. Wrong formats reach wrong platforms. Manual QC catches issues too late.
**The system:** Automated spec validation, territory-aware delivery, and verified handoff with audit trails.

---

### Archive
**The problem:** Projects end and assets disappear into unstructured storage. Retrieval takes hours or fails entirely.
**The system:** Searchable archive with preserved metadata, linked documentation, and instant retrieval.

---

## WHY TEAMS ADOPT IT

**Clarity**
Everyone sees the same information. No conflicting versions of reality.

**Version truth**
One canonical version. Always. With history attached.

**Accountability**
Every approval, every change, every decision—logged and traceable.

**Risk control**
Rights expirations, legal gaps, and compliance failures surfaced before they cost money.

**Less rework**
Feedback captured correctly the first time. No re-edits from miscommunication.

**Fewer surprises**
Status is visible. Blockers are flagged. Nothing slips through.

**Predictable delivery**
Specs validated. Timelines tracked. Deadlines met without heroics.

---

## THE ROI

**Time saved:**
40% reduction in time spent searching for assets, chasing approvals, and managing versions.

**Money saved:**
Production teams report $15K–$50K saved per project in avoided rework and duplicate effort.

**Rework prevented:**
80% fewer revision cycles caused by unclear feedback or wrong versions.

**Reshoots avoided:**
Teams catch missing coverage and rights gaps before wrap—not after.

**Legal mistakes eliminated:**
Zero releases used past expiration. Zero unlicensed assets in market.

**Storage cost reduction:**
60% reduction in duplicate files and orphaned assets across active and archive storage.
